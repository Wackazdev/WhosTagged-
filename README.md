# WhosTagged?
WhosTagged? is a legal mod for Gorilla Tag adding a menu to the game that shows who is tagged, and who is not. It also shows how close the lava monkey is by the players name.
(this is a legal mod, you can use in public lobbies but it doesnt add any advantage that is considered cheating)

REQUIREMENTS: Utilla Or Newtilla
